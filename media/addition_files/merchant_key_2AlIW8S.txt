My sweetheart, you are all that I need, all that I want and all that will ever ask for. You are my joy and happiness
They say you only fall in love once, but that can’t be true… Every time I look at you, I fall in love all over again.
Explaining to you how much and why I love you, would be like me describing how water tastes. It’s impossible.
